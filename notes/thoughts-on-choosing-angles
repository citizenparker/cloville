Thoughts.

For each segment, treat a (360 - MIN ANGLE) circle of possibilities as a weighted distribution:
  Water / impassable terrain gets a zero distribution
  Towards shortest segment to a highway gets a very, very high distribution
  Parallel to highway gets a high distribution
  Same as previous segment gets a medium distribution (could not apply to new segments)
  Towards population center gets a medium distribution
  "minor uphill/downhill gradient" gets a small distribution
  "major uphill/downhill gradient" gets a small distribution

  THESE STACK!

Treat as attractors / repellors?

Rejection Sampling - plot as above, then use water / topography to clamp the function down. THIS IS PROBABLY SLOW - TREAT IN 5 DEGREE INCREMENTS? Assuming a 30-degree minimum angle, that's 66

Instead, have a few rules that generate possible angles as above. Include the "random" rule in certain cases, add a little randomization to the other rules if needed.

Don't forget the difference between global goals and local. Some of these decisions should be made independently!
